It is crucial to distinguish the difference between datasets both from appearance and underneath. While most of the package focus on difference of appearance (structure and data itself), few have pay attention to the statistical difference which is more interesting to researcher. This package try to create such function to provide user the ability to spot difference both structurally and statistically.">

<p>The big-data opportunity is compelling in complex business
environments experiencing an explosion in the types and volumes of
available data. In the health-care and pharmaceutical industries, data
growth is generated from several sources, including the R&amp;D process,
retailers, patients, caregivers and etc. Effectively utilizing these
data will help pharmaceutical companies better identify new potential
drug candidates and develop them into effective, approved and reimbursed
medicines more quickly. As a result, companies are hiring analytics
teams to serve business units, and even as data became more crucial to
decision-making and product roadmaps. However, the teams in charge of
data pipelines were treated more like plumbers and less like partners.
With better tooling, more diverse roles, and a clearer understanding of
data’s full potential, most forward-thinking teams are adopting a new
paradigm: data as a product(<code>DaaP</code>). In the DaaP model,
company data is viewed as a product, and the data team’s role is to
provide that data to the company in ways that facilitate good
decision-making and application building. Some important characteristics
of this model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data has an SLA (figuratively) from the entire data team, not just
data engineering</li>
<li>Data flow is unidirectional, from the data team to the company</li>
<li>Domain expertise has limited benefits for data team members</li>
</ul>
<p>While each of these definitions has its own nuance, there are clearly
some key takeaways: treating data as a product involves serving internal
“customers” (data consumers), enabling decision-making and other key
functions, and applying standards of rigor like SLAs. The key step is to
apply a data as a product mindset is how you build, monitor, and measure
data products. So when it comes to building pipelines and systems, use
the same proven processes as you would with production software, like
creating scope documents and breaking projects down into sprints. One of
key sprints is the ability to track the difference of data product over
time. In order to achieve this goal, we build a custom ‘ddiff’ function
to tackle this problem.</p>

<p>Various packages have come along with utilities that could help
characterize or compare tabular data. Examples include, <a href="https://github.com/alexsanjoseph/compareDF"><code>compareDF</code></a>,
<a href="https://waldo.r-lib.org/index.html"><code>waldo</code></a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arsenal/vignettes/comparedf.html"><code>arsenal</code></a>,
<a href="http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/"><code>janitor</code></a>, and
<a href="https://rich-iannone.github.io/pointblank/index.html"><code>pointblank</code></a>.
Comparisons provided by these packages, while get us closer to something
akin to a utility that could help us interpret changes as
<code>diff</code> does, they typically fall short. For example,
<code>compareDF</code>, as the package that most directly seeks to mimic
a <code>git</code> type <code>diff</code> functionality, rather than
aiming for what’s the spirit of diff (i.e. enabling the developer to
interpret differences) mimics text tracking functionality of
<code>diff</code>, which as mentioned is not suitable for data. As a
concrete example, from information perspective, reordering of columns
and rows does not change the information-content of a data table.
However, both <code>git</code> and <code>compareDF</code> treat row
re-arrangement as change by default (i.e. when you don’t specify a
grouping variable). Furthermore, all mentioned packages shy away from
statistical information tracking. Authors, may have thought about and
consciously decided to exclude that from the scope of their projects,
given complexities of general purpose tools for what could be akin to
anomaly detection. However, given the value of such approaches, even
limited application of statistical approaches (e.g. finding univariate
extreme values which is fairly robust), could move us closer to having
tools that provide actionable <code>diff</code> like functionality for
data. The illustration below shows a comparison to implementing a diff
functionality with packages dicussed above. <img src="articles/diff1_table.png" alt="ddiff appraoch">{width=100%}</p>

<p>The are two lines of components in the ddiff function workflow. The
first is Form or base content diff. The second is Information content
diff. Form or base content diff is mechanical and quite straight forward
to implement. In contrast, information content <code>diff</code>
ventures in the realm of unsupervised learning and hence more
complex.<br><img src="articles/approach.png" alt="ddiff appraoch">{width=100%}</p>
